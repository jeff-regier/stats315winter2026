## Critique: DATASCI 315, Group Work 1: PyTorch Tensor Operations and Matplotlib

### Issues Requiring Review

#### 1. Problem 6 Could Use Better Scaffolding
**Location:** Cell 110 (Problem 6: Broadcasting)
**Description:** This is a complex multi-part problem involving tensor broadcasting, permutation, and reduction. The hint mentions `torch.arange` but does not explain how to construct the three different k-channel expressions using broadcasting.
**Why it needs review:** This is a pedagogical decision. The instructor may intentionally want students to discover the broadcasting approach on their own, or may prefer to add a worked example showing how to construct a simpler 2D tensor using broadcasting with indices. Consider whether the current difficulty level is appropriate for the target audience.
