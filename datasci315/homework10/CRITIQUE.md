## Critique: Homework 10 - CNN Concepts and Theory

### Issues Requiring Review

#### 1. Problems Lack Self-Contained Descriptions
**Location:** All problems (cells 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16)
**Description:** Every problem simply states "Refer to Problem X.X in *Understanding Deep Learning*, Chapter 10" without including the actual problem text. Students must have the textbook open to complete this assignment.
**Why it needs review:** Including full problem statements may raise copyright concerns. Instructor needs to decide whether to: (a) reproduce problems with attribution, (b) paraphrase/write equivalent original problems, or (c) keep the current format since the textbook is freely available online.

#### 2. No Scaffolding or Hints Provided
**Location:** All problems (1-8)
**Description:** The assignment provides no hints, worked examples, or guidance for any of the eight problems. Students are given empty solution blocks without any indication of where to start or what level of detail is expected.
**Why it needs review:** This is a pedagogical decision. Instructor needs to determine the appropriate level of scaffolding for this course's student population and whether the theoretical nature of these problems warrants additional guidance.

#### 3. No Indication of Problem Difficulty or Expected Response Length
**Location:** All problems (1-8)
**Description:** Students have no way to gauge how much time each problem should take or how detailed their responses should be (e.g., point values, expected paragraph count).
**Why it needs review:** This is a grading and pedagogical decision. Instructor needs to decide whether to add point values and/or response length guidance based on course grading policies.

#### 4. Missing Submission Instructions
**Location:** End of notebook
**Description:** There are no instructions for how to submit the completed assignment.
**Why it needs review:** Submission instructions are course/platform-specific and require instructor input.
