## Critique: Homework 5 - Shallow Networks, Loss Functions, and Fitting (Concepts and Theory)

### Critical Issues

1. **Problem Statements Are Missing**
   - **Location**: All problem cells (Problems 1-8)
   - **Description**: Every problem simply references a UDL exercise number (e.g., "UDL 3.4") without including the actual problem statement. Students must have the textbook open to understand what they are being asked to do.
   - **Why problematic**: This creates a poor user experience and makes the assignment inaccessible to anyone without the textbook. It also makes the notebook non-self-contained, which is poor pedagogical practice. If the textbook version changes or becomes unavailable, the assignment becomes unusable.
   - **Suggested fix**: Include the full problem statement (or a paraphrased version if copyright is a concern) directly in the notebook for each problem. At minimum, provide a brief summary of what each problem asks.
