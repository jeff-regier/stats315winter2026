## Critique: Homework 5 - Shallow Networks, Loss Functions, and Fitting (Concepts and Theory)

### Issues Requiring Review

#### 1. Problem Statements Are Missing
**Location:** Cells 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 19 (Problems 1-8)
**Description:** Each problem only references a UDL exercise number (e.g., "UDL 3.4") without including the actual problem statement. Students must have the textbook open to understand what they are being asked.
**Why it needs review:** Including full problem statements from the textbook involves copyright considerations. The decision to paraphrase, summarize, or include full text requires human judgment about copyright compliance and pedagogical intent. The instructor may have intentionally designed this assignment to be used alongside the textbook.
